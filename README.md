# Simple Text Analyzer and Mini Grep

## Simple Text Analyzer

### Overview
This program reads a text file and calculates various statistics, including:
- Total number of words
- Total number of characters
- Frequency of each word (word count)
- Most frequent words

Additionally, it provides a visual representation of word frequencies using a basic bar chart.

### Usage
To use the program, follow these steps:
1. Compile the program using a C compiler (e.g., GCC).
2. Run the compiled executable, providing the text file as input.
3. The program will display the calculated statistics and the word frequency chart.

### Variations
- Advanced analysis like identifying the average sentence length could be implemented in future versions.
- Additional visualization options could be added for more sophisticated data representation.

## Mini Grep

### Overview
This program mimics the basic functionality of the grep command-line utility. It accepts two command-line arguments: a search pattern (string) and a file name. It searches through the specified file and prints out all lines that contain the given search pattern.

### Usage
To use the program, follow these steps:
1. Compile the program using a C compiler (e.g., GCC).
2. Run the compiled executable, providing the search pattern and file name as command-line arguments.
3. Optionally, provide an optional flag (-i or --ignore-case) to make the search case-insensitive.

### Features
- Handles command-line arguments using argc and argv in the main function.
- Reads the file line by line and searches for the given pattern in each line.
- Supports case-sensitive and case-insensitive search (optional).
- Well-commented and readable code for easy understanding and maintenance.

### Testing
Test the program with different files and search patterns to ensure correctness and robustness.
